## 🤖 How It Works

| Gesture (Right Hand)          | Meaning         |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 👍 Thumb only                 | Addition (+)    |
| ☝️ Index only                | Subtraction (−) |
| ✌️ Index + Middle            | Multiplication (×) |
| 🤞 Thumb + Index             | Division (÷)    |
| 🤜 Fist                      | Calculate result |
| 🖐️ All fingers up            | Clear expression |
| 🤏 Pinky only                | Clear last input |

| Gesture (Left Hand)          | Meaning         |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| ✋ 1 to 5 fingers             | Digits 1 to 5   |
| 🤞 Custom finger combos       | Digits 6 to 9   |
| ✊ Fist                       | Digit 0         |
